# Gender-Classification-Using-Neural-Network
The challenge of this project is to accurately predict the gender of a person based on the training data it has been provided. The problem is a binary classification task with prediction probability which use labeled data and statistical methods to produce predictions about data input classifications.

In here output variable is a category, such as „male‟ or „female‟ and predicts categorical class 
labels based on the training set and the values (class labels) in classifying attributes and uses it in 
classifying new data (Determining which class the dependent belongs to based on one or more 
independent variables.).
